				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aries</p>
<p>It could be scary for you to do anything risky for fear of conflict or failure, Aries. Perhaps you&#8217;ve tried to become invisible in different situations so you can avoid being noticed. These defense mechanisms may serve you for a while, but acting out of fear or guilt won&#8217;t get you where you need to go. To achieve what you want, you must act with confidence, love, and faith.</p>
<p>Taurus</p>
<p>This is a terrific time to start some physical activity that takes you outside and gets your blood pumping, Taurus. Don&#8217;t think this means you have to become the star player at a tennis club. A simple walk around the block every morning may be all you need to feel a boost in physical and mental energy. Note also the clarity of mind that comes when you get your body moving.</p>
<p>Gemini</p>
<p>You may feel like you&#8217;re being tested in some way and must prove that what you&#8217;re doing is valid and correct, Gemini. Fortunately, you should feel an emotional boost that will help you be confident about who you are, regardless of what other people think. The biggest tests are those that you give yourself. You are your toughest critic. Take concerted steps to go easier on yourself.</p>
<p>Cancer</p>
<p>You&#8217;re able to assert yourself with more confidence than usual, Cancer. You should have a grounded perspective regarding your emotions. You aren&#8217;t afraid to speak your mind in a situation where normally you&#8217;d only say anything that helps keep the peace. Other people may prefer that you keep things on an even keel, but you aren&#8217;t working for them. You&#8217;re working for yourself.</p>
<p>Leo</p>
<p>Just when you feel like you&#8217;ve come to a point of emotional stability and calm, Leo, something happens to throw you off balance. You may be uneasy with the notion of stability and feel what you really want is risk, action, and excitement. This inner conflict makes it hard for you to operate. Try not to over analyse every piece of the equation. The solution will come to you.</p>
<p>Virgo</p>
<p>You have lots of energy and self-confidence, Virgo. That&#8217;s wonderful, but it may also put you at greater risk for dangerous experiences and accidents. You could find that you&#8217;re much more aggressive, especially if someone crosses you. An emotional irritation could manifest in physical ways like reckless driving or arguments with people who don&#8217;t deserve your anger.</p>
<p>Libra</p>
<p>Be happy with yourself and others, Libra. Stop trying to find fault with everyone you interact with. By criticizing what they do and how they do it, you could wake up one morning and find that you have no friends. By only seeing the bad in people, you may talk yourself out of relationships with them. Be careful about coming across as a know-it-all. It isn&#8217;t your job to dictate or judge.</p>
<p>Scorpio</p>
<p>You may be bursting with energy and yearning to travel, Scorpio. At the same time, your emotions could find a way to block these thoughts. You may feel like there&#8217;s some sort of weight holding you down, making it difficult to act freely. This could cause you to act fitfully, leaving you frustrated and defeated. Calm down and take things one step at a time.</p>
<p>Sagittarius</p>
<p>You may feel a bit blue due to a nagging weightiness that pins you down to reality instead of being free to fly, Sagittarius. You may act out in an effort to prove to yourself and others that you&#8217;re somehow above Earthly things. Get over the mental block that says being grounded is a bad thing. Plant your feet firmly on terra firma. That&#8217;s how you find balance and attain your goals.</p>
<p>Capricorn</p>
<p>You&#8217;re able to work much more efficiently and effectively, Capricorn. Your energy is strong and you don&#8217;t need to fight in order to get your voice heard. Attend to details and don&#8217;t get discouraged by any discomfort that might arise. As long as you approach things with a positive attitude, everything should work out fine. You shouldn&#8217;t have to put in any special effort to be successful.</p>
<p>Aquarius</p>
<p>Different people measure success by different scales. You shouldn&#8217;t get discouraged if your accomplishment today seems small compared to what others have done in the same period. Comparisons will make it difficult for you to feel like you&#8217;re getting anywhere. Someone else will always do more. Be content with what you do today, even if it&#8217;s something simple.</p>
<p>Pisces</p>
<p>You could feel as if the battle has begun and you&#8217;re the target, Pisces. If you don&#8217;t have a solid force behind you, this period could be difficult. Emotionally, this may not be your best day. Instead of feeling your feelings, you examine them in a methodical, rational manner. It may seem like you&#8217;re dealing with them when you&#8217;re really trying to talk yourself out of feeling them at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Horoscope for today &#8211; 13th August 2016</p>
<p><strong><u>Aries</u></strong></p>
<p>You might have guests from out of town and will have to change your schedule completely. The guests will ask you for help in some urgent health matters.</p>
<p>A close friend may give you a piece of unpleasant news in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong><u>Taurs</u></strong></p>
<p>You are determined to solve a financial issue which has been bothering you for some time.</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity of joining in a new business, you should accept without hesitation. This may bring you significant benefits, with little effort and minimal risks. You may want to consider your loved one&#8217;s opinion as well.</p>
<p><strong><u>Gemini</u></strong></p>
<p>An older person will help you solve a sentimental problem. You might want to follow the advice and moderate your self-pride.</p>
<p>In the evening you may learn about a close person having fallen seriously ill. This may make you change your schedule for the next several days.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cancer</u></strong></p>
<p>Your could be facing difficulties at work and at home because of your state of nerves. This may be because a business of yours has failed and you stand to lose a large amount of money.</p>
<p>You are advised to try and remain calm, for you will tend to act on impulse.</p>
<p><strong><u>Leo</u></strong></p>
<p>Your superior at work might tell you that your vacation has been postponed because of some urgent issues that you have to deal with urgently.</p>
<p>You are advised to keep your temper, or you may trigger an argument with bad consequences.</p>
<p>Make sure you don&#8217;t take it out on your family!</p>
<p><strong><u>Virgo</u></strong></p>
<p>Business partners may be angry with you because they feel you haven&#8217;t been trying hard enough to solve certain financial issues that are your exclusive responsibility.</p>
<p>The relationship with your loved one could be rather tense. Fortunately, your communication skills are very good today and will allow you to clear all misunderstandings.</p>
<p><strong><u>Libra</u></strong></p>
<p>You might be involved in a car accident with serious consequences. Therefore you are advised to be very careful, both when driving and when crossing the street.</p>
<p>Your financial situation will soon improve. You are likely to either get a raise or a bonus at work.</p>
<p><strong><u>Scorpio</u></strong></p>
<p>You will tend to overstate your need for sentimental freedom and your loved one could misunderstand you. You are advised to remain balanced and pay more attention to your sentimental life.</p>
<p>Friends will not favor your ideas today. Make sure you express yourself clearly, in order to avoid any misunderstanding!</p>
<p><strong><u>Sagittarius</u></strong></p>
<p>Unexpected events may occur before noon, preventing you from keeping your schedule.</p>
<p>This is not an auspicious time for starting a new business, for you may fail and lose courage for a long time.</p>
<p>Listen carefully to the advice given by someone more experienced than you!</p>
<p><strong><u>Capricorn</u></strong></p>
<p>This morning you could be late at a meeting and miss a profitable deal. Don&#8217;t take it at heart! You are predisposed to vascular accidents which could seriously affect your health.</p>
<p>Try to relax and forget about your daily concerns for a while! After all, tomorrow is another day, and other opportunities will show up.</p>
<p><strong><u>Aquarian</u></strong></p>
<p>You will have to run many errands before noon. Be very careful, or you may lose a lot of money!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make a tragedy out of this and, most of all, don&#8217;t take your nerves out on your family!</p>
<p><strong><u>Pisces</u></strong></p>
<p>You might be upset because you have missed a new part-time job or because an investment proved to be unprofitable. You could feel that nothing goes your way and everybody is against you.</p>
<p>To get rid of your pessimism, you are advised to relax more. You may also want to accept your friends&#8217; invitations.</p>
